# Pokemon Library Front End
This is the front end application for my project that will create, read, update,and delete pokemon for the user. This app is designed to have a user be able to sign-up/in, from there they can access the homescreen where it has a change password or add a pokemon prompt infront of them. From there the user can create a pokemon and after they do they can show all of the pokemon that they have created. There is then two buttons beneath the pokemon with an edit pokemon script. The user can either update their pokemon that they have or they can delete it. This is an idea that I thought of and thought it was a good idea for my first full stack application. If you would like to check out the api that I made for the project, the link for it is here, https://github.com/Ralph-Francesconi007/Pokemon-backend-Api.

# Planning story
I planned this project when I first came up with the idea of what to CRUD. I figured out that I needed to CRUD pokemon and that it was a good idea. This would be a simple and useful website that people could go to and be able to create pokemon, read the pokemon, update the pokemon and delete the pokemon they create.

# Unsolved Problems
- I want a user to be able to comment on Pokemon that have been created.
- I want to be able to have the Pokemon be clicked on and it brings up a description page about them.
- I want to be able to list the recent Pokemon deleted by a specific user.
